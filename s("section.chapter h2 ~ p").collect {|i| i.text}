Alexandria‚Äôs red-brick homes and a historic waterfront promenade make it a surprisingly charming, inexpensive outpost for travelers to the D.C.-area. At $140 per night on average, Alexandria hotels run almost half the cost of their downtown counterparts, according to Hotels.com. To truly experience the Old Town neighborhood, grab an outdoor table at Hank‚Äôs Oyster Bar during happy hour on a Friday night. Hank‚Äôs is one of dozens of cafes, boutique shops and galleries that line the walkable mile of King Street that ends at the historic wharf. Art lovers should check out the nearby Torpedo Factory Art Center, a space housing 82 artist studios and seven galleries, featuring everything from pottery to stained glass. On the other end of town stands the legendary Birchmere Music Hall, where greats like Johnny Cash and Dave Matthews once played. Alexandria is also the perfect jumping off point to explore George Washington‚Äôs Mount Vernon estate ($20 for adults), says Evan Godt, a Lonely Planet destination editor for the Americas. Tour the colonial mansion and its four formal gardens, which have been restored to their 18th century appearance. Or rent a car (roughly $40 a day, reports Hipmunk) and explore Virginia‚Äôs burgeoning wine country.

The lower part of the town, in the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, acts as an open-air museum, showcasing 19th-century life. Here you can tour the town‚Äôs most well known site, John Brown‚Äôs Fort‚Äîthe armory held by the abolitionist and his army for three days in 1859 as they attempted to initiate a slave uprising.Yet the town offers more than history. Just steps from these landmarks lies the entrance to the footbridge that will take you across the Potomac River and along the scenic 184.5 mile-long Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath. You can find more challenging hikes nearby: Harpers Ferry sits in the middle of the 2,178-mile Appalachian Trail, which rewards ambitious trekkers with panoramas of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the river valleys below. In warmer weather, enjoy the rivers up close with either a paddleboard adventure or a ride on raging, class-III rapids. Fishing enthusiasts will find lots of smallmouth bass here as well.When you‚Äôre done for the day, head to the upper section of town, where shops, cafes and bed and breakfasts dot the streets.

There are more than a dozen ski resorts within 50 miles of Stateline, which offers easy access to the area‚Äôs scenic wonders at cheaper rates than the California towns across the border. To check out one of the area‚Äôs most famous attractions, ride the Heavenly Ski Resort gondola (starting at $58 for adults) to its 10,040-foot peak, where skiers and snowboarders get access to 4,630 acres of trails ($146 for a lift pass, though that includes the gondola trip). Even during warmer months, Stateline offers a full slate of outdoor activities. It costs nothing to visit one of the lake‚Äôs crown jewels, the glacier-carved Emerald Bay State Park, although you may want to budget in a paddleboard or kayak rental (about $25) to check out Fannette Island, Lake Tahoe‚Äôs only island. Or tour the 1920s mansion of Vikingsholm ($10 for adults), one of the best examples of Scandinavian architecture in the United States. With airfares and hotels down about 5% from a year ago, now is the time to visit. In fact, travelers can find good deals on flights for around $286 roundtrip from other U.S. cities, according to airfare prediction app Hopper.If the weather isn‚Äôt cooperating, test your luck at the tables.

Water laps at a shore of white sand, inviting quiet sunbathers, hikers and water-sport enthusiasts. Glen Arbor is situated in the middle of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, a federally protected park, delivering easy access to 65 miles of shoreline, forested islands, walking trails (including the paved Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail), and the park‚Äôs most prominent feature: mammoth sand dunes. Climb to the overlooks at the Sleeping Bear, Empire, or Pyramid Point bluffs and you‚Äôll be a treated to lake views from more than 400 feet up.Located on the M-22, Michigan‚Äôs most scenic highway, Glen Arbor also makes an ideal stop for those looking to do a little autumn leaf-peeping, while wine lovers come to taste the region‚Äôs bracing Pinot Blanc and Pinot Gris. Visit the lakefront dining room at Blu to watch the sunset and sample local wines alongside upscale American dishes, such as the venison chop with walnut wild rice. If you need a more kid-friendly food destination, try Cherry Republic for a cherry Boomchunka cookie‚Äîor one of 200 other cherry-based products. Year-over-year prices for a hotel room in Glen Arbor have dropped 21%, according to Hipmunk, making this the year you should have a Michigan summer.Average airfare: $278[1;35m\n[0m[31mAverage hotel night: $124[1;35m\n[0m[31mCost to spend a week for two: $2,125Enjoy all that Florida beaches are known for‚Äîwarm ocean waters, long stretches of golden sand, and tons of sunshine‚Äîat a fraction of the cost with a stay in Pompano Beach, otherwise known as ‚Äúthe Heart of the Gold Coast.‚Äù Sitting on the Atlantic Ocean just north of Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach is an ‚Äúaffordable and family-friendly alternative to other South Florida hotspots,‚Äù says Lonely Planet‚Äòs Evan Godt.

Pompano still offers more than enough to satisfy every kind of water lover. From the shore, you can access natural coral reefs. Scuba divers can swim around 18 shipwrecks in the area‚Äôs water. The Okinawa, sunk just off the 1,000-foot-long Pompano Beach Pier, makes for a great beginners dive, with the top of the wreck sited just 40 feet below the surface.Named for a type of fish, Pompano Beach attracts plenty of sport fishers too. Every May, the town hosts a fishing rodeo; some catches can earn more than $18,000. Families will love the beachside playgrounds, complete with grills and picnic tables, as well as the shoreline itself‚Äîat more than 100 yards wide, it gives kids more than enough space to bury their siblings and build castles.Average airfare: $249[1;35m\n[0m[31mAverage hotel night: $208[1;35m\n[0m[31mCost to spend a week for two: $2,713Stunning architecture, top chefs, rabid sport fans, and impressive museums: The Windy City delivers it all, and at a discount this year, with both airfare and hotel rates down since 2016.

You can go all out and pay big bucks for the best sushi experience of your life, but you could just as easily find major flavor for ¬•800‚Äîless than $8. ‚ÄúEven a simple bowl of noodles at a modest restaurant can rival any you‚Äôll find elsewhere,‚Äù says Laura Crawford, destination editor for Lonely Planet.

But go beyond the historic landmarks and you may find the Italian capital‚Äôs energy derives more from the here and now, with streets that teem with pedestrians and buzz with Vespas.‚ÄúA trip to Rome is as much about lapping up the dolce vita lifestyle as gorging on art and culture,‚Äù says Lonely Planet‚Äôs Anna Tyler. Dotted with outdoor cafes and scene-stealing piazzas, Rome‚Äôs winding lanes reveal why Rome has been inspiring greats‚Äîfrom Michelangelo to Fellini‚Äîfor generations. Not that you should skip Rome‚Äôs most famous attractions, like the Colosseum ($15 for adults) or the Vatican Museums ($21 for adults). Getting to the Eternal City has gotten much more affordable. Kayak estimates airfares to Rome are down almost 19% over a year earlier. To keep your budget in check, skip expensive taxis and Ubers (which start at ‚Äúblack car‚Äù pricing) and tackle the surprisingly compact city by foot or on Rome‚Äôs relatively inexpensive public transit system. A ride on the city‚Äôs trains, buses, and trams costs just ‚Ç¨1.5 a ticket, less than $2.Rome‚Äôs food culture can also help keep you on a budget.

This colonial city features broad central plazas where you‚Äôll find locals catching up and playing music, historic churches such as the San Ildefonso Cathedral and homes that hide behind pastel-colored facades. It also boasts an impressive art scene. The Popular Art Museum showcases objects from around Mexico and the Museum of Anthropology and History, located in a Beaux Arts mansion, displays Mayan artifacts.Don‚Äôt limit your visit to the city‚Äôs limits. M√©rida is a perfect base for excursions into the region‚Äôs UNESCO-listed archaeological sites. Drive east and you‚Äôll find Chich√©n Itz√°, one of Mexico‚Äôs best-known ruins, where the 98-foot-high step pyramid known as the Temple of Kukulcan dominates the skyline. An hour south, see ornate stone carvings and the rounded sides of the towering Pyramid of the Magician at the less crowded site of Uxmal. Be sure to swim in one of the area‚Äôs 6,000 freshwater sinkholes, known as cenotes, which were used as sacred wells by the Maya. Some can be found in another of the region‚Äôs gems: the Reserva de la Bi√≥sfera R√≠a Celest√∫n, a 146,000-acre wildlife reserve that shelters mangrove forests, a huge flamingo colony, and sea turtles.

Catch one such juxtaposition near the city‚Äôs 40-foot-tall Ming-era walls, which cast shadows on the 21st-century caf√©s and boutique hotels nearby. Rent a bike near the South (‚ÄúYongning‚Äù) Gate and spend an afternoon riding along the 600-year-old structure. You can also taste the sour soups and hand-pulled Biangbiang noodles found at street vendors and cafes throughout Xi‚Äôan.A trip to Xi‚Äôan would not be complete without visiting the famous Terra-Cotta Army. A museum just outside the city center ($22 for adults in high season) walks visitors through the history of these 8,000 statues, as well as the 1974 excavation that unearthed them after 2,000 years.To get here, fly into Xi‚Äôan Xianyang International Airport; Hopper says you can find good deals for around $631.

Tour the latter‚Äôs underground bunker to see where the Allied victory was plotted during World War II.No trip to London would be complete without a stop at a local pub; have a pint (or four) while watching a game of ‚Äúfooty‚Äù or rugby. One historic option is the charmingly gloomy Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese: Rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1666, its one of the city‚Äôs most famous pubs, having nourished Samuel Johnson and Charles Dickens.
